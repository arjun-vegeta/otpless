# Pre-Built UI

> Leverage our Pre-Built UI for rapid integration and customization of authentication flows in your application. This setup allows you to adjust appearance and functionality through the OTPLESS dashboard with minimal coding.

export const SampleGithubContainer = ({platform, href = '/api-reference/endpoint/verifytoken/verify-token-with-secure-data', text = 'authenticity of sign-in'}) => {

};

### Step 1: Add the OTPLESS JS

To integrate the OTPLESS Sign-in into your website, include the following script in the `head` section of your HTML.

```html theme={null}
<!-- OTPLESS SDK -->
<script
  id="otpless-sdk"
  type="text/javascript"
  data-appid="YOUR_APP_ID"
  src="https://otpless.com/v4/auth.js"
></script>
```

<Tip>
  Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with [your actual App
  ID](https://otpless.com/dashboard/customer/dev-settings/apiKeys) provided in
  your OTPLESS dashboard.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Embed the OTPLESS Login UI

Insert the following HTML where you want the OTPLESS login UI to appear:

```html theme={null}
<!-- OTPLESS Login UI -->
<div id="otpless-login-page"></div>
```

<Warning>
  Ensure your site is served over HTTPS to enable the sign-in widget to load
  properly. Use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) for a secure
  tunnel during local development.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Configure Authentication and UI

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Configure Auth Method" icon="key" iconType="duotone" href="https://otpless.com/dashboard/customer/channels">
    Choose from various authentication methods such as SMS, WhatsApp, Email, and
    Google to optimize user access.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Configure UI" icon="palette" iconType="duotone" href="https://otpless.com/dashboard/customer/customization">
    Customize your authentication interface to align with your brand's identity
    and enhance user experience.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Step 4: Handle Authentication Callback

Implement a callback function to handle the authentication response and manage user data:

```javascript theme={null}
<script>
  function otpless(otplessUser) {
    const token = otplessUser.token;
    console.log('Token:', token);
    console.log('User Details:', JSON.stringify(otplessUser));
  }
</script>
```

## **🏁 Checkpoint**

To ensure a smooth integration process:

1. Deploy your app/website with the included OTPLESS SDK.
2. Conduct tests to verify the sign-in flow functions correctly.
3. Ensure that after a successful sign-in, the user is redirected back to your app/website and their information is correctly logged in the console.

### User Information Response Structure

The structure of the user information returned upon successful sign-in is as follows:

```json theme={null}
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "token": "unique_token_here",
  "userId": "unique_user_id_here",
  "timestamp": "ISO_timestamp_here",
  "identities": [
    {
      "identityType": "EMAIL",
      "identityValue": "user@example.com",
      "channel": "OAUTH",
      "methods": ["GOOGLE"],
      "name": "User Name",
      "verified": true,
      "verifiedAt": "ISO_timestamp_here",
      "isCompanyEmail": "true"
    }
  ],
  "idToken": "jwt_token",
  "network": {
    "ip": "127.0.0.1",
    "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
    "ipLocation": {}
  },
  "deviceInfo": {},
  "sessionInfo": {},
  "firebaseInfo": {}
}
```
